## Critical Collapse with a Test Quantum Field

This is C code for the simulation of test quantum field in the background geometry undergoing critical collapse. We adapt the code build by [Dr. Benjamin Berczi](https://github.com/benjibrcz) that corresponds the simulation of gravitational collapse of quantum field. More detail and original code can be found [here](https://github.com/benjibrcz/PhD/blob/master/README.md)
