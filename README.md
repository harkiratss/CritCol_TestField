## Critical Collapse with a Test Quantum Field

This is C code for the simulation of test quantum field in the background geometry undergoing critical collapse. We adapt the code build by [Dr. Benjamin Berczi](https://github.com/benjibrcz) that simulate the gravitational collapse of quantum field. More detail and original code can be found [here](https://github.com/benjibrcz/PhD/blob/master/README.md). The results of the simulations are presented [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04701).
